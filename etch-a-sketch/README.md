## My approach on the fourth project of TOP
---
- A simple etch-a-sketch made from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- The guideline told me not to use **grid** layout for this but I want to finish this one quick so I can wrap up *Foundations*.
- There are some many things to improve and I'd love to hear feedback from you.
- Feel free to use it as a reference.
- Having a good day reading this.
