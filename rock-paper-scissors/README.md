## My approach the third project of TOP
---
- A classic rock-paper-scissors game made to be played through a simply put together UI.
- It used to be written in pure JS but now It's completed with both HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Here, I used a bunch of new things that was not mentioned in TOP's Foundations roadmap up to this point. You might want to Google stuff if you are new.
- Feel free to check out my source code and use it if you like.
- Have a good day reading this.
