## My approach on TOP first project
---
- A plain, simple website that displays recipe of some dishes that I know and love.
- Created and written purely using HTML tags and nothing else.
- Bonus usage of git.
- All recipes which include ingredients and cooking process and images are taken from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/)
- Feel free to use this as a reference if you are new to this (just like me)
- Have a good day reading this.
