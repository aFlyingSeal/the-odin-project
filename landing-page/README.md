## My approach on the second project of TOP
---
- A simple landing page created using HTML and CSS.
- It was quickly put together within an hour or so, expect a lot of imperfections from my design guys.
- The only image I used was a picture of my favourite seal. I kinda forgot where I had taken it so in the mean time I'll leave a temporary link here for referencing and I'll update it as soon as I can. Credits: [Yuki The Ringed Seal](https://english.kyodonews.net/articles/-/7853)
- Feel free to use and edit this template.
