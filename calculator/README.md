## My approach on the final project of TOP's *Foundations* path
---
- A calculator made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript altogether.
- I actually made this once but with the help of **eval()** and now retackling this again without using it surely feels a bit hard.
- The HTML and CSS were nothing (although I used **grid** layout to save time) compared to the amount of JavaScript being put to this, so much more logic.
- Anyway, that's a wrap up for this path. Feel free to use this for reference (I'm planning to implement delete button soon, not right now too tired)
- Have a good day reading this.
