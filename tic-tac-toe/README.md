## 10th project for The Odin Project
---
- A tic-tac-toe game with minimal amount of styling put together using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- This project was mainly for increasing your grasp of Javascript skill. It's quite difficult I have to admit. It's highly recommended to redo this afterwards if you used help in your previous atempts. _(i might come back to this later)_
- [Alex Younger's portfolio](https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out) also helped me how to figure out the usage of ```IIFE``` which is one of the main thing this project is trying to point out for you.
- Have a good day reading this.
