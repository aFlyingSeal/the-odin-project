## Odin Foundations

This repository contains all of projects prior to the _Webpack_ lesson from The Odin Project curriculum.

Each folder is a standalone project which was simply put together using HTML, CSS, Javascript and nothing else.

That's why most of the folder in here only contains 3 files: **.html**, **.css** and **.js** (occasionally a folder for containing images and a **README.md** for most of the file)

I decided to make this into an archive from now on since after the _Webpack_ lesson every project is now required (i guess) to be in seperate repos.

This repo will also be renamed from *the-odin-project* to *odin-foundations* for future reference.

Have a good day reading this.
