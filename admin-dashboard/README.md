## My approach on the seventh project of TOP
---
- An admin dashboard based on the given example.
- Made entirely using HTML and CSS. The main purpose was to test your *grid* skill but I actually used both *grid* and *flexbox* here instead.
- Feel free to use this as a reference for your work. I apology if my CSS file is too messy sometimes, I will work on cleaning soon.
- Here are the sources of all the assets that I used:
    + [Blank avatar for trending section](https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/profile)
    + [Color pallette](https://coolors.co/palettes/popular/dashboard)
    + My actual profile picture is from me I guess.
    + [Icons that I used](https://boxicons.com/)
- Have a good day reading this.
